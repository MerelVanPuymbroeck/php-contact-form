# php-contact-form

### What?

processing a contact form with PHP that really works. 

### When and where?
I did made this is from 1 august until 7 august , in The Beacon for BeCode.

### What are the requirements ? 
- [x] Working with PhP
- [x] A working form
- [ ] Errors 
- [x] Sending a message and really getting the message

### Why don't you see the errors?

The errors are there, they dont display because I didn't make space to display it. So I am still bussy fixing that :shit:

### What did I use to get this forum working?

    if ($name == "") {
    array_push($errors, "name is empty");
    }    

As you can see above I did work with a if statement where I let the errors work.

### Did I like this task?

Yes I did like it, but in the beginning I found it verry dificult to understand it how PhP works. But now I am glad how it looks and how I made it. 
Still I need to work quiet a bit more on my php skills. 

### How did I felt me while working on this task for these days?
